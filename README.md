# DeepLearningA-Z
Deep Learning A-Z course at Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/overview)
>This online course provide the opportunity to learn about the following Artificial Neural Netowrk (ANN) related algorithms in Python 3.
- ANN
- Convoluted NN (CNN)
- Recurrent NN (RNN), mainly Long-short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Self Organizing Map (SOM)
- Restricted Boltzmann Machine, 
- Auto Encoders

All the source code I wrote in this course and the data files are available in the following links.
